The dog could run away

I would use a keychain tracker that I would attach to their collar while I was walking the dog.

Multiple dogs might fight

I would only walk one dog at a time and if the business grows, I would have other employees walking one dog at a time.

They could poop in peoples yards

I would carry plastic bags with me in a fanny pack that was equipped with extra leashes, other batteries for the tracker, my phone for taking calls and tracking dogs, pepper spray in case I get ambushed by hostile people or dogs.
