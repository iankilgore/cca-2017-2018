sight
bright, plain white walls, all the lights are on (compact flouresent), antique victorian couch that is white with gold threads, soft dusty rose chair, small colored stained glass lamp, dark wood table with two chairs, antique coat hanger with mirror, room divider screen black lacquer folding room divider, giant wall oil painting of orange and red poppies by artist Dennis Reinke

sound
humming refrigerator, neighbors, diffuser, kids playing in the courtyard, footsteps of other people going up the stairs, chirps of song birds outside window, periodic fussing of my baby brother, sound of the metal pipes expanding and contrcting as steam flows through baseboard heat pipes, hissing of the main furnace of the apartment building, arming of cars in the parking lot, 


touch
wood chair, open window cool breeze, sunshine warms the room, fuzzy carpet under feet, smooth walls and ceilings, my personal room closet that is cozy and private and allowing time to me by myself, cozy matress with soft pillows and blankets, pretty basket filled with colorful rolled hand towels in the bathroom, feel calm and safe in apartment, soft blankets on couch

smell
dishwasher, essential oils of pine and cinnamon, chicken, furniture, aromatic spices in the kitchen cupboard, clean lemon hand soap, warm springtime breeze that smells like grass, warm electronics in bedroom, smell of other people smoking coming in apartment, smell of rain
