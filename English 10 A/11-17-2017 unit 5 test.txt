Prompt I:
In "Marriage is a Private Affair" by Chinua Achebe, and "A Meeting In the Dark" by Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, the personalities of the young men and their fathers shape the eventual outcomes of the stories. In the first story, Nnaemeka tells his father that he marries his true love Nene, instead of agreeing to a traditional arranged marriage. He is open about his choice to marry Nene. Nnaemeka tries to convice his father that she is a good, schooled Christian. His father, although angry stays calm, but chooses to never meet his son's wife or accept them as a couple, stating, "whoever put this idea in your head might as well have cut your throat. It is Satan's work." Nene chooses to continue to reach out to her husband's father and when he learns he has grandsons who want to meet him, his heart softens and he reconsiders his previous position. In the second story, John has gotten Wamuhu pregnant and isn't sure he loves her enough to marry her because she isn't well schooled and was circumcised. He also doesn't want to lose his chance to go to the university. He feared his dad so much that he tries to pay Wamuhu to go away and basically goes crazy in a panic, "He is mad. He is foaming. He is quickly moving toward the girl in the dark." Despite his girlfriend giving him months to do the right thing, he doesn't tell his family about her, or love her, instead, he murders her! Sadly, he should be more afraid of people finding out about the murder than the fact that he got a girl pregnant.

Prompt II:
In "No Witchcraft For Sale" by Doris Lessing, and "The Moment Before the Gun Went Off" by Nadine Gordimer, both stories show mutual deep regard between the main white and black characters. But in one of the stories the regard is hidden and in the other it is public. In the first story, Gideon treats the Farquar's son, lovingly called "Little Yellow Head," as his own son by playing with him very sweetly. The mom payed Gideon more because she could see it was genuine love. Even as the boy grew and Gideon knew things would change, "Ah missus, these are both children, and one will grow up to be a baas, and one will be a servant," Gideon saved teddy's eyesight when he was spat on by the tree snake. In contrast, Van Der Vyver accidentally shoots his son while out hunting and is so concerned about the judgement from others that he thinks, "How could they know that they do not know." He worries he will be seen as careless and just shooting his black help when he really cared for his son and his family. He withholds sharing the truth out of fear of society not accepting him. Similarly, in the first story, Gideon withholds the knowledge of the plant that can cure the snake spit blindness as Gideon wants to protect his tribal culture and not sell out for money. Despite his love for Teddy, he does not wish to share the cure with all whites. In the second story, the father treats his hunting partner well but hides from everyone that he is his son. In both stories the racism in their societies is overwhelming. In both stories, deep regard is not public, but only held in close relationships as they don't want to lose their place in their culture.
