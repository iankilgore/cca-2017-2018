In Huckleberry Finn the setting is on a raft on the river. It creates movement through places and the river always keeps the characters and the reader constantly on the move. It takes Huck and Jim through night and day to different places and different people. And along the way it's also symbolic of their friendship moving on and Huckleberry Finn's thoughts to himself and growth.

The setting of the river itself is physically bigger and more powerful than the other surroundings and the people and the weather that they encounter. And so it is the main force that carries huck and Jim through their adventure. Water is essential to life and this river is representative of life in that it moves them through night and day and through good and bad and through place and time. 

The setting of the raft can create a greater focus for the story so the author can zoom in and zoom out and create situations of intimacy and situations that are very public. It would be like if I took my camera on a bus ride and videoed myself discussing my own thoughts and then turning my camera outside and videoing things I am passing. The setting on the raft on the river allows the author a lot of flexibilty when narrarating different parts of the story.
