In my compare and contrast essay, I am going to write about two of my favorite hobbies which are flying my drone and recording with my GoPro.  Both of these are similar in that I record tons of videos and edit them for YouTube or personal use.  One of the main differences is that my drone can do aerial shots and my GoPro can go under water.  I enjoy doing both of these hobbies because I can get points of view that I wouldn't otherwise get.
