By mixing and approximate numbers, the author is able to use a kind of humor through exaggeration to really convey to the reader how people are. For example, "wise after the fact - just a couple more than wise before it" shows how people struggle to learn from their mistakes and she tries to point that out through numbers. She is able to use exact numbers humorously when she says "able to admire without envy, - eighteen." Even though we know she just made up the number eighteen, we know she is trying to say there's not enough of those kind of people around in a light way. She is able to close the poem strongly by stating "mortal - a hundred out of a hundred. Thus far this figure still remains unchanged."
