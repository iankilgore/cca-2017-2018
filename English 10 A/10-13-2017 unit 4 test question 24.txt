Eugene Ionesco, who wrote "Rhinoceros" uses a light tone to tell a tale of mysterious rhinoceroses that start off mostly hidden and people don't know where they are coming from. But over the course of the story, more and more appear and terrorize those around them. "Collective psychosis," retorted Botard, who was a free thinker, "just like religion, the opium of the people." Ionesco shows how people doubt that the rhinoceroses even exist as more and more are created. Even though the tone is light, it shows how people felt living in fear of their friends changing before their eyes. Czselaw Milosz on the other hand uses a more serious tone to convey to the reader that the fear was real and the world was falling apart. "In spite of fires on the horizon, castles blown up, tribes on the march, planets in motion." Milosz definitely feels that the people will perish and only their words, in books, will remain after the spread of Nazi beliefs.
