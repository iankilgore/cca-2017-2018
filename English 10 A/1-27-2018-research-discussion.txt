I want to discuss more about the hacker culture worldwide. I have "woken up" to a lot of issues in our society, and I have found out that a lot of the stuff I have been told was a lie, and one of the ways I have tried to find out truth is by hacking, and it's a way of exposing the truth. I would say that it is where I fit in to the hacking culture. When you hack into something that has the truth that has been hidden from you, not only will you know the secrets that have been hidden from you, but you also can expose the truth if neccessary, but just be careful about this because you might get in trouble.
