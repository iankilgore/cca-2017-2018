23. War is addressed in both the novels "Cranes" and "Tokyo." In "Cranes," two men on opposing sides discuss the conflict try to understand each other as equals not because their status was equal, but because they attributed an equal respect to each other. In "Tokyo," it seems like the character's quest to understand war from a place of ignorance invites usery rather than respect.

24. I would describe him as uncompromising. He was ill but would never let his illness slow him down. He wouldn't apologize for something this wasn't his fault. And lastly, he was just as uncompromising with his revenge because nothing mattered more.

25. People generally can't understand each other especially if they are from such different cultures or experiences. I can't understand why some people really like doing school and choose to keep doing it. I like learning and exploring new technologies but I like doing it in a real life setting. In an academic setting it almost seems fake, like a game, instead of real.

"Stuff, stuff, give me some stuff."  If I am east then this might be west because again, I don't understand it. This is a common theme on American TV so I would think that locality is just a metaphor for the distance between people. Because I live in America.

In the Saboteur, who can relate to a person bent on such revenge that he's willing to harm innocent people? Someone from the East? Or someone from the West? Or someone from a similar experience, or culture, or illness? I don't really know, I just know that again we are just bumping into east or west here and I am on the opposite side.

In Cranes, two men who had the experience of growing up together and shared events there seem to be a better understanding in discussing even the reasons for being on the opposite sides of a war. It seems that maybe the bond created by shared experiences at least gives people the ability to respect each other enough whether they understand each other or not.
