Wislawa Szymborska, who wrote "A Contribution to Statistics," addresses death in a more personal way than Czeslaw Milosz. When considering 100 people who have died, he comments, "Righteous - thirty five, which is a lot. Righteous and understanding - three." He seems to be writing about people he knows. In death a sort of truth comes out and we can't hide from it. Czeslaw Milosz who wrote "And Yet The Books," addresses death of people in terms of the fascist time he lived in being more violent and unstable. "I imagine the earth when I am no more: nothing happens, no loss, it still a strange pageant." He seems grateful that although the people are not valued in this time, that the books will continue on to tell their stories.
