In Derek Walcott's, "Love After Love," the author writes a vivid poem of inviting self love.  "You will love again the stranger who was yourself."  Often we live our lives for school or a job, or family demands, forgetting what we are at our core.  We become a stranger that we don't even recognize.  This poem struck me because the author speaks of a time when "with elation you will greet yourself" and you will "Feast on your life."  The poem just reminds you to not ignore the self within that knows and loves you best.
