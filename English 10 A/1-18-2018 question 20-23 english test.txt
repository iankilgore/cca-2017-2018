A restoration comedy is what we saw in London starting around 1660 and it generally had complicated plot, sexual humor, cynicism, and a good amount of English wit.

We see wit and cynicism in this quote "Relations are simply tedious packs of people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die." This is an exaggeration that is said in a witty way that expresses great cynicism in that it says that people should just die because they don't know how to live and they are annoying.

wit: I never go without my dinner. No one ever does, except vegetarians and people like that.

cynicism: It is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth

sexual humor: The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.

The repetition is absurd, and the question is absurd, it's absurd that we are even talking about this because we should know better how to live, or else just die.

They seem to be a mother figure and a father figure and it's just him expresssing his distaste toward his upbringing. Maybe he names her miss prism because he feels like she bends light and splits it into muliple colors and maybe that's his intention with this character. Chasuble sounds like Chaucerable sounds like Chaucer. That character would serve the same purposes as a Chaucer character and make fun of religion.

The sandwiches aren't a big deal because you can just make more. But eating all of the sandwiches symbolizes how selfish and inconsiderate he is. This trivial symbol of eating cucumber sandwiches demonstrates a severe character flaw especially when he lies about it after. Possibly the trivial "tea party" symbol even demonstrates how Algernon perceives this character flaw as being trivial.

Food is a primal need and he ignored everyone elses primal needs. This situation could apply to any primal need and he is going to take what he needs at the expense of others. Food symbolizes primal needs in this case. And I could extend to show that he would take/ruin someone elses life to make himself happy. And this is reemphasized when he devours the muffins.

Gwendolen tells Cecily, who has just offered her sugar and cake, that sugar is “not fashionable any more” and “Cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.” Cecily responds by filling Gwendolen’s tea with sugar and her plate with cake. It's this nice gesture that masks that if someone does this it's mean. I would get angry every time because it is the opposite of what I said. And because it's sugar and cake we can see it is being sickeningly sweet as in kind, but in a disgusting sort of way. In this case the food is symbolic of sickeningly sweet relationship that is actually gross between the two.
