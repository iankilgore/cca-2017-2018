Laura is presuming that the Middle East and South Asia are standing at a crossroad of cultural and religious change. Where is the evidence that proves this change? These cultures and religions have endured thousands of years of people wanting them to change and any attempts to force any change. Many wars have been fought either defending or persecuting in these areas In the story no name two men who are boyhood friends and now caught up on opposite sides of a war are changing their religions or cultures. In the Armenia story we can see that language and literature is something that preserves cultural and religious beliefs. These cultures and religious beliefs are preserved even when a people is in exile or have their lands taken away. There may be a crossroad but that doesn't mean that it is a dead end for a particular culture or religion and even though 2 people or even a thousand people may choose a different path on the crossroads the roads themselves for any particular culture or religion continue to exist because the crossroad is less important to people who are living their lives than it is to people who want to intellectualize the age old idea that a religion can change or a culture can change in their lifetime. When these ideals are much larger and more powerful than any person who is going to be standing out the crossroads. Laura acan name any religion or any culture and say it's going to seize to exist in it's current form, and 90% of people who adhere to those sets of beliefs will continue to adhere to those sets of beliefs.
