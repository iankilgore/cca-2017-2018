26. In the Latin American story "Crossroads: A Sad Vaudeville," Carlos Solorzano writes about the theme of fear of rejection.  A young man goes to a train station to meet a woman he only knows through a fake photo and words.  When she comes to the station she doesn't identify herself and instead tries to see if the man will recognize her.  When the man can't seem to find her, the woman he is talking to says, "Nevertheless, you must realize that perhaps she's afraid to reveal herself, that maybe she's waiting for you to discover her."  She continues, "Above all when you begin to fall asleep, the solitude of your body, a body alone, that inevitably ages" Shows she's afraid that the man will think she is too old.  When Kimberly Koza says, "By discovering the literature of our neighbors, we may also learn about ourselves" she knows that all humans struggle with a fear of rejection.  We see that this fear is more powerful than taking a chance at love.  Sadly, the two never meet.

27.  Canadian author, Alice Munro, wrote a short story, "Day of the Butterfly" with a theme of difficult friendships.  Myra Sayla is not very popular because she has to care for her little brother.  Helen tried to become her friend by giving her a butterfly pin from a Cracker Jack box, she then worried about becoming unpopular too.  "And I was glad she did not put it on.  If someone asked her where she got it, and she told them, what would I say?"  At the party at the hospital, Myra tried to give Helen a present and she saw it as dangerous," I'll give it away, I thought, I won't ever play with it.  I would let my little brother pull it apart."  It is sad how people want friends but they are too worried about how they will be viewed by others that they lose a may be friend.
