American writers often focus on the journey of one person and the struggles they go thorugh.  For example, Samuel Selvon, in "When Greek Meets Greek" shows the reader the struggle of immigrants to even get an apartment in America.  "Acha, pilau, papadom, chickenvindaloo" is a desperate attempt to fool others into thinking that the tenant is Indian and in the end he fails.  Also, in "Love After Love" by Derek Walcott and "Day of the Butterfly" by Alice Munro, the authors address self respect and discovering one's self and the torments of isolation and lonliness respectively.


European writers often focus on religion and how it affects a person.  In Frank O'Connor's "First Confession" we see the main character struggle with wanting to kill his grandmother, and probably his sister, too.  But the story is really about the religious aspects of meeting with the priest who says to Jackie, "The crimes of a lifetime.  I don't know will I get rid of you at all today."  Jackie goes to confession for the first time and, after hearing a wivestale, is worried about giving a bad confession and burning in hell for it.  After the dreaded event, the priest actually sides with Jackie over his stress with his sister and he says, "Someone will go for her with a bread knife one day, and he won't miss her."  The priest seems to inject the fear in the story with hope that we seem to make it through childhood somehow.

European writers also will look at why people act they way they do.  In "The Destructors" by Graham Greene, the author shows the cold-hearted actions of a gang of boys.  What is the motive for destroying Mr. Thomas' house?  They don't hate him.  In fact, Trevor says, "There'd be no fun" in destroying the house if they hated Old Misery.  Seems like the gang didn't like that the man was spared from the bombing and had a "beautiful" house.  They wanted him to live a life more like theirs.  The story really looked at the motivations that drives people in groups to behave in ways they might not when alone.
