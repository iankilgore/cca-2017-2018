In this discussion, you will discuss how the use of technology in the graphic design field affects the environment. Many types of art media can have a negative effect on the environment. With advancements in technology, the digital camera, the computer, and other technologies have replaced many of these potentially harmful art media, such as various types of paint.

In the past, a graphic designer might use toxic paints and non-recyclable materials to create their message. Then if that work needed to be sent out to a large audience, the amount of paper, ink, and even packaging materials was very high. Now, with designers using computers and software, elaborate projects can be created without using any natural resources except for the electricity to power the computers. Also too, with the use of the internet, the same message can be sent to an almost infinite amount of views. This saves trees, protects our water, and lessens trash in the landfill since people can delete emails instead of putting junk mail in the trash.
