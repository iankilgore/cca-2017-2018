1.  Design is thought out plan for creating something that is functional, looks good or communicates something to the user.  Art is not functional but is appealing to the person looking at it.  Decoration is something that is added to something plain to make it look nicer.  Visual literacy is basically how one gets meaning from an image.

2. Design and problem solving are related because you must try to predict a situation a user will have while using the product.  For example, the cable on my GoPro is too short so it's hard to use while charging it.  If the designer had tried using it beforehand, I'm sure they would have made the cable longer.

3. The three main purposes of design are aesthetics such as designing a flower garden, communication such as a street sign, and functionality such as in safety uniform clothing.  When designing furniture or appliances for a house, the user wants them to be fully functional and easy to use, but to look very nice and make their house pretty so you are combining aesthetics and functionality.

4. It is important to prioritize your focus when designing for multiple purposes so that you don't have an ineffective product.  For example, you want a website to look pretty, but if the user cant figure out how to get around or can't find the information they are looking for quickly, they may leave your website no matter how nice it looks. 

5. Sometimes when you are advocating for a specific cause, let's say for example, adopting homeless animals, you want the viewer to see your ad and want to adopt pets.  The way you will get to the person is with cute pictures of animals.  So knowing how to use the right amount of pictures and text is important to getting people to care about your cause.
