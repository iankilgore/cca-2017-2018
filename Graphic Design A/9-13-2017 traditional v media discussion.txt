In this discussion, you will discuss technology and graphic design. With the continual expansion of technology, the media used for graphic design has changed significantly. Compare and contrast traditional versus digital media. How has technology enhanced graphic designers' ability to create innovative, effective designs? How might technology advancements hinder the graphic design process?

Traditional media are things like printed fliers, posters or banners, television commercials and advertisements.  In traditional media, the designer will use things such as paper, paints, and other objects that are costly and use resources.  When a designer is able to use digital media, they are not very limited.  For example, in the past, a photographer would need to do a photo shoot on location to have cool pictures of the beach.  Now a designer can use stock photos and layer them with their own creations to save time and money with the same effect.  The only downside with digital media is that it is 2 dimensional compared to sculpture or other types of art.
