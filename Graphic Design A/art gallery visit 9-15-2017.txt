This museum has many different types of both fine and applied art such as sculpture, paintings and even architecture and graphic design.  I literally saw every single type of media that I could possibly think of in there such as photos, oil paintings, pieces of furniture and digital media.  No, there was not an overall theme to the artwork that was exhibited.  They had collections on things as different as Asian art, American Indian art, textiles, and photography.  Graphic design is related to what I saw because the artist is trying to convey a message to the viewer.  There was one collection that had a lot of cool chairs, just by looking at them you would feel totally different.  

1. Wiggle Side Chair, by Frank O. Gehry, is a laminated corrugated cardboard and fiberboard chair made in 1972. This chair was a part of a group of chairs called Easy Edges Furniture.  The chair was light, strong, low cost, and comfortable. I think the artist wanted show the viewer that a chair could be comfortable and good looking.

2. Olivetti, by Giovanni Pintori, is a lithograph printed on paper made in 1949. This piece of art was a poster which was trying to convey a message about the company. They made adding machines and the poster showed a bunch of numerals in a colorful coded pattern with the company's name in the center. It was created to make the viewer at ease with their new product.
