27. The viscosity of magma and gases dissolved in the magma determines whether a volcano erupts explosively or quietly. For example, if the magma is really thick, it doesn't flow very well and builds up pockets of gases so when it explodes it is very dramatic. Whereas when the magma is fluid-like it will erupt more quietly.

28. The three types of volcanoes are cinder cones which only erupt for a very short period of time and are pretty small. Shield volcanoes are pretty flat such as in the Hawaiian Islands. Composite cones are very big and often are found in the Ring of Fire such as Mount St. Helens.
