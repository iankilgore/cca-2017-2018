24. The first kind of wave is called a P wave and they are compression waves that compress and expand whatever they are travelling through. They cause the ground and roads to break. P waves can travel through liquids and solids. S waves on the other hand only go through solids. S waves are transverse waves and they make the ground go up and down but not break. Surface waves can go up and down and back and forth, these wave cause the most damage.
