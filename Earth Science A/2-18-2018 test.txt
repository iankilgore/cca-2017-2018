1. warm front - Forms when a moist, warm air mass slides up and over a cold air mass. Thunderheads can form as the moisture in the warm air mass rises, cools, and condenses. As the front moves through, cool and fair weather is likely to follow. 

2. cold front - Forms when cold air mass pushes under warm air, forcing warm air to rise. As the warm air mass rises, it condenses into a broad area of clouds. A warm front brings gentle rain or light snow, followed by warmer, milder weather.

3. stationary front - Forms when warm and cold air meet and neither air mass has the force to move the other and they remain stationary. Where the warm and cold air meet, clouds and fog form, and it may rain or snow. Can bring many days of clouds and precipitation.

4. occluded front - Forms when warm air gets caught between two cold air masses and the warm air mass rises as the cool air masses push and meet in the middle. The temperature drops as the warm air mass is occluded from the ground and pushed upward. Can bring strong winds and heavy precipitation.


26. Burning of fossil fuels will emits greenhouse gases as the product of combustion. The greenhouse gases are trapped in the atmosphere which makes the global temperature rise. Its effects are drastic while some other living organisms can adopt to these changes, some organisms can die from too much heat.
