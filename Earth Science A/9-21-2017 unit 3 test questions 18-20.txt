18. There are clastic sedimentary rocks which are formed by layers of sediments. They vary in the size of particles, with conglomerate being the largest particles up to shale having the smallest particles. The second type is chemical sedimentary rocks which are formed when minerals precipitate out of a water solution. When the water evaporates it leaves rocks such as rock salt and limestone.

19. The first agent is pressure which increases as you go down compacting the rocks. The next one is hydrothermal solutions. These are basically hot liquid that is coming out of magma and it is recrystallizing making new rocks. Lastly heat is an agent for metamorphism due to the intense heat coming from the earth. One or more of these processes creates metamorphic rocks.

20. An igneous rock is created when magma comes out of the earth and cools. Over time the rock will be weathered by water, air, and other things it is exposed to. The rock is broken down into small sediments. Eventually those sediments will be compacted and cemented together to make a sedimentary rock. Over time the sedimentary rock will get buried in the earth. If it gets a lot of pressure it will turn into a metamorphic rock. It can melt to go back into magma. This magma can then be shot back up to the earth's surface to begin the cycle again.
