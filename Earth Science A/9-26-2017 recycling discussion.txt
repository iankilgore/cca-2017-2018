One benefit to establishing a mandatory recycling program would be full participation especially if there were some kind of incentive for doing it. Even if the only thing recycled was 100% of all the aluminum, we wouldn't have to mine as much of it for new cans. One drawback of a mandatory recycling program would be the need for more trucks, fuel to collect all of the recyclables and increased air pollution because of it. In the mountain town I live in, there are a ton of restaurants that have a lot of glass beer and wine bottles to dispose of. Here we have to pay to have curbside recycling or you have to take it to the center yourself. I know most people don't want to spend more money, so it ends up getting thrown away. I believe recycling would benefit the environment as a whole. If we didn't have to create so much packaging materials and could keep our landfills for true waste, it would preserve more land for future generations.
