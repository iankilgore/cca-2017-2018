Kepler was a German astronomer who discovered three major laws of planetary motion, the planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus; the time necessary to traverse any arc of a planetary orbit is proportional to the area of the sector between the central body and that arc, and there is an exact relationship between the squares of the planets’ periodic times and the cubes of the radii of their orbits.

Galileo made major contributions to the fields of physics, astronomy, cosmology, mathematics and philosophy.

Newton developed the three laws of motion which form the basic principles of modern physics.
