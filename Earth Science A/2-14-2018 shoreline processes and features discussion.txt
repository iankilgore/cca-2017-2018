I have visited South Padre Island, which is a barrier Island and there is a couple of things that are done that are artificial, one is that there are channels cut in the island for boats to pass through and this doesn't seem to harm the environment really. Another thing that I saw was that seaweed was washed up overnight and is then raked into piles to create sand dunes and prevent erosion, this is good in that it helped with preventing the erosion but it also destroys natural feeding ground for a lot of the marine life because the seaweed is removed.
