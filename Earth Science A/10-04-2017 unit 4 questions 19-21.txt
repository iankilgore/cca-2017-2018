19. Solar power is renewable because the power from the sun is infinite, wind energy is also renewable because it doesn't expend any energy when it is made. Nuclear energy is also renewable in that you can keep making it with small amounts of radioactive material but you must remember that it is also a very dangerous alternative. Tidal energy is also renewable in that you are capturing energy by trapping tides that occur naturally but this is only available in a few places.
