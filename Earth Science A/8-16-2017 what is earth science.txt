When you think about planet Earth, you may have questions about its origin, its current state of health, and its place in the solar system.

Such questions may include:

How did Earth form?
Why does Earth revolve and rotate?
What processes create and change landscapes on Earth?
How is Earth different from the other terrestrial planets?
The answers to these questions—and others—can be found by studying the field of Earth science. Because Earth science covers a variety of topics, it is divided into four specialties: geology, oceanography, meteorology, and astronomy. In this lesson—and throughout this course—you will learn about these four areas of study, as well as the hypothesis behind Earth’s formation.
