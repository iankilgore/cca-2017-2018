The water cycle starts with the sun evaporating ocean water and the wind moves the air over land. The moisture in the air comes down as precipitation. Then the precipitation soaks through the ground and gradually works its way to the ocean through streams. Some of the water gets used by plants and they release water into the atmosphere through transpiration. Some of the water gets held in snow and ice on earth. This balanced cycle keeps repeating itself.
