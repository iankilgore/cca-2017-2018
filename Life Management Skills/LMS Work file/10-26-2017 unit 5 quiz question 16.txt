I plan to stay healthy and active through the winter months of November-February by exercising no less than 3 days a week with activities such as going for a walk, riding my bike, flying my drone, or doing Xbox Kinect games. I need to meet this goal since I like to work on technology which keeps me inside often in my bedroom. Taking friends or family with me has been helpful. I average about 2 days a week right now, due to the obstacles of cold or bad weather and my desire to stay inside.
