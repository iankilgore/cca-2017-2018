Dear Friend:

I am worried about you because I'm not sure you understand how bad smoking is for you.  I want to tell you some of the things second hand smoke does to your body. The smoke affects your still growing body's respiratory system, your bones and muscles, even your circulation and digestive systems.  Worse, it can even affect your future kids.  It can even affect your mental health.  You are at higher risk for heart attacks and strokes and many kinds of cancer.

Even if you don't care about hurting your body, you could get in a lot of trouble for smoking since you are too young.  Since you are under 18, you can get community service, fines, and even lose your driver's license! You could waste a lot of time in court and taking mandatory classes.

I really hope you will talk to me about stopping smoking.
Ian
