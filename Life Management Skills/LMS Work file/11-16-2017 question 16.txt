Dear Mr. John Smith,

On 11/03/2017, I purchased a 2017 Toyota 4 Runner. I made this purchase at Larry H. Miller Toyota in Boulder, CO. They are located at 2465 48th Court, Boulder, CO 80301.
Unfortunately, the car has not performed well because the breaks have been squeaking awfully ever since I ever got it. I have had the car unsuccessfully repaired 2 times. I know that the Lemon Law states that this critical repair must resolve the problem the first time.

Therefore to resolve this problem, I would appreciate a full refund of my money ($44,000.00). Enclosed is a copy of the Bill of Sale.

I look forward to your reply and a resolution to my problem, and will wait until the close of business on 12/13/2017 before seeking third party assistance. Please contact me at the above address or by phone at (970) 588-3456.

Sincerely,
